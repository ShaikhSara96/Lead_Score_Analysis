# Problem Statement
An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry
professionals. On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the
courses land on their websites and browse for courses. The company markets its
courses on several websites and search engines like Google. Once these people
land on the website, they might browse the courses or fill up a form for the course or
watch some videos. When these people fill up a form providing their email address
or phone number, they are classified to be a lead. Moreover, the company also gets
leads through past referrals.
Once these leads are acquired, employees from the sales team start making calls,
writing emails, etc. Through this process, some of the leads get converted while
most do not. The typical lead conversion rate at X Education is around 30%. Now,
although X Education gets a lot of leads, its lead conversion rate is very poor.
For example, if, say, they acquire 100 leads in a day, only about 30 of them are
converted. To make this process more efficient, the company wishes to identify the
most potential leads, also known as ‘Hot Leads’. If they successfully identify this set
of leads, the lead conversion rate should go up as the sales team will now be
focusing more on communicating with the potential leads rather than making calls to
everyone. A typical lead conversion process can be represented using the following
funnel

Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.

# CONCLUSION:-
The prediction testing proves that the model can effectively detect hot leads. By using the optimal cutoff value, the model showed it could accurately identify hot leads. The classificatino report at the end gives a quick overview confirming that the model is pretty good at determining if a lead is hot or not.
